# twstatus-bot

This is the more user friendly variant of the Teeworlds Server Status Bot which uses the DDNet HTTP master servers for fetching its data contrary to polling each individual server on its own.

## User guide

Add this bot to your Discord server: [Click here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=628902630617513985&permissions=18685255740480&scope=bot)

### Discord setup commands
Initially you need to specify which channel you want to allow the bot to post into.
This is done by simply executing the command `/add-channel` in the channel that the bot is supposed to write the server status messages into.
Afterwards you stay in the same channel and add tracking for your Teeworlds servers like this `/add-tracking address:123.123.123.123:8301` or for ipv6 addresses you use `/add-tracking address:[fe80::9656:d028:8652:66b6]:8303`

If you want to remove tracking, you simply delete the messages that the bot created.

When you are done with your setup, you finally need to activate the channel to be updated by the bot like this `/start` in the corresponding channel.

If you want to stop the from updating server status messages for a specific channel, you can execute the `/stop` slash command in that channel.

All of these commands provide an optional parameter called `channel` which you can use to execute all of these commands in a different channel from the channel that you want to use for posting server status updates.


## Hoster guide
In case you want to host this yourself, you can use this guide to do so.

### build instructions

There are about three ways to get you up and running.
In case that you have the Go compiler toolchain installed, you can execute:
```shell
go install github.com/jxsl13/twstatus-bot@latest
```
This downloads, compiles and installs the executable into `echo "$(go env GOPATH)/bin"`.

Alternatively you can clone this repository and build the executable yourself.
Use `make build` or `go build .` for that purpose.

Lastly, you can build and deploy the docker container using `docker compose` by calling `make deploy` (`make redeploy` and `make stop`).
